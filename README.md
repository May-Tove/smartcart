## Description

The SmartCart application provides a variety of features to offer a seamless shopping experience for its users:

    Displaying a list of products on the homepage.
    Individual product pages with detailed information, including title, description, image, and reviews if available.
    Adding items to the cart from the product page.
    A cart page listing all added products with a total cost, and a checkout option.
    A checkout success page indicating a successful order placement and offering a link to go back to the store.
    A contact page with a form ensuring data validation.
    Using React Router to navigate between pages.
    A responsive design that works across different device types.

The project's aim was to apply the knowledge of React.js gained during the course and create a practical, real-world-like web application.
